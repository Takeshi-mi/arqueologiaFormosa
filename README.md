This starter is a part of [Schema UI](https://schemaui.com) project, which is a collection of components for building websites with Sanity CMS.

You can clone the repository and start building your website with the components.

Create a new `Sanity project` at [sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/manage).

Add `http://localhost:3000` to the `CORS Origins` in your Sanity project settings.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:serge-0v/next-js-sanity-starter.git
```

2. Rename the `example.env.local` file to `.env.local` and add your `Sanity project ID` to `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` and `development` dataset to `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` to the file.

```bash
cd next-js-sanity-starter
mv example.env.local .env.local
```

3. Create and copy token from the `API` section with Viewer permissions in your Sanity project settings.

4. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

5. You can create a demo page with the following command (`produciton` is the default dataset name from Sanity):

```bash
pnpx sanity dataset import demo.tag.gz produciton
```

6. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

6. Open the browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the demo page.

7. Your Sanity admin is available at `http://localhost:3000/studio`.

8. Once you're ready to deploy your website, make sure you add live url to the `CORS Origins` in your Sanity project settings.

9. Deploy your website to Vercel by creating a new project and adding your `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` dataset to the environment variables.

All environment variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` - your website url. For example, `https://yourwebsite.com` without trailing slash.

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_ENV` - development or production. Used for metadata. For example, if you deploy and want to have staging website on subdomain `dev.yourwebsite.com` and don't want search engines to index it, you can set this variable to `development`.

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION` - your Sanity API version. You don't have to use specific dates, any past or present date is valid, and today's date will always give you the latest version - no need to check release history. For example: `YYYY-MM-DD`.

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` - your Sanity project ID. For example, `abc12345`.

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` - your Sanity dataset name. For example, `production`.

- `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` - your Sanity read token for Next.js to fetch data.

- `RESEND_API_KEY` - your RESEND api key for the newsletter form.

- `RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID` - your RESEND audience id for the newsletter form to store contacts.
